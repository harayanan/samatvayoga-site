  shortBio:
    "An accomplished scholar of the Vedas, Upanishads, Sanskrit, and the Bhagavad Gita, Shri Siddhartha Krishna brings the timeless wisdom of the ancient rishis to seekers across the world with clarity, devotion, and deep reverence for the tradition.",
  fullBio: [
    "Shri Siddhartha Krishna was raised in the family tradition of Yoga, immersed from earliest childhood in the wisdom of India's spiritual heritage. His mother, Shrimati Usha Devi, an advanced Iyengar Yoga teacher, began teaching him the Bhagavad Gita when he was just four years old. By age seven, he had memorized all seven hundred shlokas of the Gita and studied its major traditional commentaries under the guidance of his father.",
    "He received his formal education at the Kailas Ashram Brahma Vidya Pitha in Rishikesh, a venerable monastery dedicated to the teaching of Vedanta. This institution has deep historical connections to luminaries such as Swami Vivekananda, Swami Ramatirtha, Swami Tapovan, and Swami Sivananda. Under the tutelage of Swami Vidyananda Giri Ji Maharaj, he pursued advanced studies in the Upanishads, Advaita Vedanta, Sanskrit grammar, and Indian logic (Nyaya).",
    "Following his studies, he served at the monastery as a teacher of Sanskrit grammar and Indian philosophy, while also editing their Vedanta publications. This deep grounding in both the theoretical and practical dimensions of the tradition gives his teaching a rare depth and authenticity.",
    "Today, Shri Siddhartha Krishna teaches at the Patanjala Yoga Kendra in Rishikesh — the Iyengar Yoga centre founded by his mother — and at Swami Rama Sadhaka Grama. He also travels internationally as a guest instructor, bringing the teachings of the Gita, the Upanishads, and the Yoga Sutras to students and yoga communities around the world.",
    "His teachings are characterized by extraordinary clarity, profound scholarship, and a living connection to the lineage of the great masters. He has published translations of and commentaries on Sanskrit texts, and contributes regular columns to the Australian Yoga Life quarterly magazine and Yoga Journal China.",

  philosophy:
    "The word 'Samatva' comes from the Bhagavad Gita (2.48) where Lord Krishna declares: 'samatvam yoga uchyate' — Yoga is equanimity. This balance of mind in success and failure, pleasure and pain, gain and loss, is the very essence of Yoga. It is not mere physical postures but the transformation of one's entire being towards a state of inner equilibrium and Self-knowledge.",
  approach:
    "Rooted in the traditional guru-shishya parampara (teacher-student lineage), the teachings draw from the Prasthana Traya — the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahma Sutras — the three foundational pillars of Vedantic wisdom. Sanskrit is not merely a language of instruction but a living vehicle of spiritual truth.",
